#SITES
* [Learn CSS layout](http://book.mixu.net/css/) 
*I wrote this site of chapters to describe those rules. It's long-form writing, but not book-length. I don't think I'd want to write a full book about CSS, but writing about CSS layout has been useful.*
* [Learn CSS Layout](http://learnlayout.com/)
*This site teaches the CSS fundamentals that are used in any website's layout.*
* [CSS Layout Techniques: for Fun and Profit](http://www.glish.com/css/)
*I am cataloging here as many useful cross-browser CSS layout techniques as I can find, and some that I made up when I was bored last Thursday. All the examples on this site have been reduced to only their essential code, and you will find the source displayed on each page to hopefully make it quick and easy to understand the inner workings of the CSS. Feel free to steal all the code you find on this site, and consider linking back here on your site or in your source comments.*
